### __<ins>How do I start working on a task?</ins>__
```markdown
1. git checkout main
2. git pull
3. git checkout -b feature/XXX-123
4. git push origin feature/XXX-123

5. git add .
6. git commit -m "XXX-123 Add Hello, World!"

7. git add .
8. git commit -m "XXX-123 implement text classification"
```

### __<ins>What should I do when I‚Äôve finished a task?/ins>__
Carefully answer the questions below before considering your work as complete and ready for review.
Pushing to the repository means that all other developers will build and run your code, and it will be pushed to Main. You should make sure your code is functional.

* Does my code execute?
* Does my code produce any errors or unexpected warnings?
* Does my code result in any performance regression?
* Is my code readable?
* Have I separated my code out into a good system of functions?
* Does my code fulfil the criteria outlined in the task?

### __<ins>Submitting your scripts to Code Review</ins>__
1. Push your local changes to the remote repository
```markdown
1. git checkout my_branch
2. git push origin my_branch
```
2. Navigate to the Github website and find your branch. You should then see this notification to open a pull request

3. First fill out the description of the task. Then add everyone on the team as reviewers. Finally, create the pull request.

4. After at __least__ 1 other member of the team has reviewed your code and approved it, you can merge the pull request to the main branch.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/PabloMemescobar/solid-doodle/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
